Currently I am a graduate student at [Computer Science Department, University of Saskatchewan, Canada](https://www.cs.usask.ca/) and a member of [Software Research Lab](http://srlab-new.usask.ca/). I am doing my research under the supervision of [Dr. Chanchal Roy](https://www.cs.usask.ca/~croy/). My research focus is to develop productive tools for developers from program comprehension perspective. I have completed my B.Sc. from [Computer Science and Engineering Discipline at Khulna University, Khulna](http://cseku.ac.bd/).
